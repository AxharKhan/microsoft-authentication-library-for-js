## IAppTokenProvider interface

Extensibility interface, which allows the app developer to return a token, based on the passed-in parameters, instead of fetching tokens from the Identity Provider (AAD). Developers need to construct and return an AppTokenProviderResult object back to MSAL. MSAL will cache the token response in the same way it would do if the result were comming from AAD. This extensibility point is only defined for the client\_credential flow, i.e. acquireTokenByClientCredential and meant for Azure SDK to enhance Managed Identity support.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface IAppTokenProvider 
```
