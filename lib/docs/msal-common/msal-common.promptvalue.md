## PromptValue variable

we considered making this "enum" in the request instead of string, however it looks like the allowed list of prompt values kept changing over past couple of years. There are some undocumented prompt values for some internal partners too, hence the choice of generic "string" type instead of the "enum"

**Signature:**

```typescript
PromptValue: {
    LOGIN: string;
    SELECT_ACCOUNT: string;
    CONSENT: string;
    NONE: string;
    CREATE: string;
    NO_SESSION: string;
}
```
